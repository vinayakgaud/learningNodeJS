Version
4.18.2
1st Part -> 4
2nd part -> 18
3rd Part -> 2

//3rd part Minor Updates, like cosmetic typhography or minor fixes, which we can update but its not show stopper (Optional)
-> we can check change log and then decide if need to update or not
//2nd part Recommended bug Fixes, (Security fix), recommended to update, critical fixes, change in functionality or security fixes
-> we are recommended to update
//1st Part Major/ Breaking Update, we should not update to this version, if we are working on already created app, which uses version 4 for ex then we should not update to version 5 as that update may break the code and our code might not work, and if we are working on completely new app, then we should use latest version
-> we should see the change logs and update it if required only for new app

-> ^ (compatible with version) means install all recommended and minor fixes but not major version
^4.18.2 means, whenever we update or package npm update system will update the recommended and minor version but not major version
it will change to 4.19.4 or so but no 5.0.0

if we have version with carrot symbol 4.18.2 it means version is lock never update the version, we will have to manually update the version

~ - approximate version
~4.18.2 - it will onlyh update minor version and not update major and recommended versions
