REST API - with JSON data

Servers should be hybrid server as it should support both browser and mobile

GET /users - List all users so if we get endpoint as /users it means it is in browser so we can render HTML,
GET /api/users - if it has api infront of it then it will pass json and frontend can handle it
GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2

Dynamic Path parameter
GET /api/users/:id

when we mention :id it means id variable / dynamic

POST /api/users - Create a new user

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

Delete /api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
