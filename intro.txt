dom and window element of JS is removed in node we cannot run it in node cli
file handling, cryptography, hashing is added in node
npm init to start node file, to create package.json
we can write our own scripts also in package.json of node, and run it using npm run scriptName, npm scriptName

run js in node as `node filename`
and it we add that file in  package.json as script 
npm run scriptName/ npm scriptName

console.log('Hey there') //we can run it in node using node hello
console.log(window) //as it is web element it doesn't work in node
/**
 * console.log(window)

 npmjs is node package manager javascript it has all packages that we can install in our node

 if we have any dependency in package.json and we mistakenly delete node_modules then we can run npm install to install all dependencies

 all our install package dependencies code are under node_modules
